First of all, remember use the right node version:

```bash

nvm use

```

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```
